      <p class="inEnglish1">The Bronze Head from Ife, or Ife Head, is one of eighteen copper alloy sculptures that were unearthed in 1938 at Ife in Nigeria, the religious and former royal centre of the Yoruba people. It is believed to represent a king. It was probably made in the fourteenth-fifteenth century C.E.. The realism and sophisticated craftsmanship of the objects challenged Western conceptions of African art. The naturalistic features of the Ife heads are unique in Africa, and today are seen as the highest achievement of African art and culture. The stylistic similarities of the Ife heads "suggest that they were made by an individual artist or in a single workshop". A year after its finding, the Ife Head was taken to the British Museum.</p>
